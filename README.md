Razer Battery Tray
=======================

I also thought it would be easier to install than the python version I saw, so I wanted to make my own basic test.

I may take a look at properly releasing this package if I end up using it but as my device has an obvious indicator on the wireless base there is not a lot of use for this.

This was just an experiment for doing tray icons for using Rust on linux easily.

I may add more but for now the plans are just battery level, and maybe quick access to adjust the polling rate.
