Rusy Razer Tray
=======================
I may add other items but atm this just will list the battery of the first razer item that has a battery.

This currently contains a rushed wrapper for openrazer based on [libopenrazer](https://github.com/z3ntu/libopenrazer) in rust and has only been tested with the battery capabilities.

If anyone would like me to continue this project feel free to open an issue or discussion. Otherwise, it'll just be for me messing around.

I plan to make it so that I can adjust some basic settings e.g. the polling rate and such or the DPI and show other info about the device.
